# COVID-Etude
​This was an instrument for an in-person group performance piece called a "COVID Étude", named for music  intended to be reminiscent of aspects of the COVID quarantine period.

For sound design, I used a variety of nature sounds, including crickets, birds, the ocean, and water. My group mates had either musical sounds or urban sounds, which faded over time while the nature sounds increased in volume. The ultrasonic sensor controlled two different parameters in an Ableton. The first parameter was volume of the nature sounds, which increased as I moved my hands farther away from the sensor and from my group. This symbolized the fact that as we grew away from in-person connections and the wasteful side effects of technology, the more nature we experienced. The second parameter triggered four audio clips, which were organized so that the farther away I was from the sensor, the more distant clips were played (ex. ocean and water sounds).
